# Decision Log

## 2026-03-24
- Keep `quant_mvp/db.py`, `quant_mvp/backtest_engine.py`, `quant_mvp/selection.py`, and `quant_mvp/project.py` as the reusable low-level core because they already expose deterministic, testable primitives.
- Rewrite `scripts/run_limit_up_screening.py` so it cannot drift away from the modular pipeline.
- Introduce schema modules (`quant_mvp/strategy_schema.py`, `quant_mvp/config_schema.py`) as the single source of truth for defaults and contracts.
- Introduce provider/data validation abstractions instead of binding update logic directly to AKShare response quirks.
- Keep the agent control plane dry-run capable by default; a live LLM backend is optional and never required for tests.
